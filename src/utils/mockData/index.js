          "labeltext": "Maurice Wertheim (1886–1950), Harvard Class of 1906, was an investment banker from New York. He began amassing his renowned collection in the 1930s, acquiring masterpieces by famed artists like Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, as well as contemporary figures such as Aristide Maillol, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. His interest in modern art was informed by recommendations from advisors, who included Alfred M. Frankfurter, editor of the highly read periodical Art News, and Paul J. Sachs, associate director of the Fogg Art Museum from 1923–45.\r\nWertheim’s decision to focus on nineteenth- and twentieth-century art also derived from practical considerations. Like other American collectors purchasing art after World War I, Wertheim perceived that art from this era was both critically acclaimed and financially accessible. An added benefit, for him, was the fact that its scale and varied styles were well suited to his modern penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side of New York City, where the works were first installed.\r\nWertheim bequeathed his collection to Harvard, to be studied and enjoyed by students and scholars, with the stipulation that it be shown together in a single gallery.",

Berman Collection\r\nThe year 2019 marks not only the centennial of the founding of the Bauhaus school of art and design, but also the official founding of Germany’s Weimar Republic (1919–33). In the midst of upheaval in Germany after World War I, artist groups formed with the aim of transforming society. Despite their radical beginnings, however, many of these groups fizzled by the mid-1920s amid relative stabilization. This installation introduces artists with a range of stylistic approaches from across the country—Berlin, Karlsruhe, Hannover, Cologne, and Düsseldorf—who foregrounded class struggle and the material and cultural circumstances of workers’ lives well into the final years of Germany’s first democracy. Many of the artists featured here were associated with the German Communist Party or other radical organizations on the German Left. \r\nAs exemplified by the portfolio Hunger at the center of this gallery, printmaking played a key role in the dissemination of ideas. In an age of new technologies, many artists nonetheless remained committed to painting and drawing as a means to unite artistic form with left-wing politics. Socially critical art of the Weimar period has often been considered synonymous with the \"left wing\" of New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit), as exemplified in the work of Otto Dix and George Grosz seen here. A number of key artists, whose work is also on view, fall outside this category, however, or actively challenged it at the time. \r\nIn The Art Lover (1937), by American social realist Mervin Jules, a bald, bespectacled man—a stereotype of ruling-class wealth and privilege—views a painting of demonstrating workers in a smoke-filled industrial landscape. This painting-within-a-painting provides a point of departure: how is a painting of a workers’ demonstration, one likely made to encourage class consciousness, to be understood by its viewers? By a bourgeois aesthete? In a museum? What do the works of art in this gallery have to tell us today about art’s role in society? ",

          "labeltext": "The mid-twentieth century witnessed the traumatic consequences of global industrial warfare as well as the oppressive hand of state control on the rights and freedoms of individuals. Disillusionment with the progress of Western civilization led some artists to call for a break from the past. They rejected realist styles as too easily drafted for propaganda purposes, and the ideas of most prewar avant-gardes as contaminated by their association with cultures that had performed savage acts against civilians. As the American painter Barnett Newman said, “We have to start all over again.” Western European artists, including Alberto Burri and K. O. Götz, began to work under the umbrella of art informel. Coined by the French critic Michel Tapié, the term describes an eclectic coalition advancing intuitive and spontaneous methods of painting allied with the unconscious improvisation championed by surrealism, one of the few earlier movements whose ideas were considered relevant to the postwar condition.\r\nIn the United States, a group of largely New York–based artists, many of whom had trained in realist styles at the Art Students League during the 1920s and ’30s, searched for alternatives to figurative art in the 1940s. Among them were Adolph Gottlieb, Franz Kline, and Jackson Pollock, all represented here. A significant influence for this group was the Manhattan-based Hans Hofmann, an elder German artist and theorist who had “thrust painting into the future,” as Frank Stella described it, by creating works that probed the volumetric and psychological qualities of color. Proceeding with their own intensely personal explorations of the spatial and perceptual possibilities of paint using unorthodox materials and techniques, artists of the younger generation originated processes that implicated the movements of their bodies and the traces of their gestures as content. Variously referred to as abstract expressionism, action painting, and the New York school, the movement’s innovations were celebrated by some critics as an assertion of America’s cultural ascendancy.\r\nAs the works in this gallery attest, artists on both sides of the Atlantic who explored painterly abstraction shared the conviction that making art is a deeply subjective and psychologically charged enterprise.",

          "labeltext": "During the turbulent decades of the early twentieth century, which included political unrest in Russia; renewed alliances between Russia, France, and Great Britain; and the devastation of World War I, European and American avant-garde artists made works that express a profound philosophical, cultural, political, and pictorial rupture with nineteenth-century conventions. While the late nineteenth century revolutionized the depiction of light and color, the early twentieth century revolutionized the depiction of space and time. These transformations were spurred by technological changes such as the development of both lightweight, inexpensive still cameras and moving pictures, by scientific discoveries such as the theory of relativity, and by demographic shifts, as groups of émigrés and pilgrims gathered in the capitals of Europe and America, exchanging ideas and images.\r\nThe rapid changes in artistic approach that mark this period were sometimes sequential, but more often simultaneous or overlapping, creating an expanding network of influences. The more muted palette of Pablo Picasso’s and Georges Braque’s early cubist landscapes followed fauvism’s fantastically chromatic anti-naturalist approach to the same subject, whereas Juan Gris continued to employ bright color in his slightly later interpretation of cubism. These incremental phases of cubism’s radical rethinking of spatial and temporal representation, which took place primarily in France, were echoed by developments in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and the USSR. The early modernist embrace of the perceived authenticity of “primitive” art—medieval, peasant, folk, and African—found expression in all media, but is particularly evident in sculpture. Paintings, sculpture, and works on paper all underscore the early modernist allegiance to pictorial explorations of the relativity of perception, memory, and movement.",

While many artists and intellectuals embraced the war enthusiastically at its outset, their experiences in the trenches and on the home front led to widespread disillusionment. Political uncertainty and the destabilization of German culture in the war’s wake led many artists to question their role in society, the viability of art as an agent of social change, and the relevance of traditional artistic media. During this frequently volatile period between the world wars, Germany became one of the most dynamic, innovative cultural centers in Europe.\r\nBy 1918, the two primary expressionist groups, Brücke (Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), had long since dissolved, but individual expressionist artists emerged from the war as a driving force. The increasing institutionalization of the movement, and its ubiquity in everything from propaganda posters to commercial advertisements, however, caused even former supporters to doubt its critical power, and by 1920 they had declared it dead. The decade that followed was thus largely marked by tendencies either originating in or polemically opposed to the movement. Such postexpressionist production became best known under the rubric Neue Sachlichkeit (typically translated as New Objectivity), and was characterized by an unsentimental and socially critical view of the world.\r\nFormed in 1919, the Bauhaus, the progressive German school of art and design, began as a manifestation of the expressionist, utopian spirit of the immediate postwar period. It was organized into workshops and sought to bring together artists, designers, and craftsmen as equal partners in creating art, objects, and environments. Around 1923, however, Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius called for a “new unity” of art and technology, and the school’s emphasis shifted away from craft toward industrial design. Extending beyond its walls to include like-minded members of the international avant-garde, the Bauhaus network led to a radical rethinking of art’s role in a technological age.\r\nThe artists represented in these galleries sought not only to redefine the relationship between art and politics, but also to revolutionize human perception. They did so within traditional forms like painting and sculpture, or by embracing new media such as photography, film, and collage, making this period one of extraordinary creative production.",

          "labeltext": "The spread of materialism in America during the economic boom that followed World War II led some artists to respond by withdrawing into the purely internal operations and phenomenology of art and art making. Clement Greenberg, one of the most influential American art critics of the twentieth century, coined the term “post-painterly abstraction” to define what he saw as a dominant feature of this turn. The subject of an exhibition Greenberg organized in 1964 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, it describes a move by some painters toward the delineation of geometric shapes using intensely chromatic but thinly applied pigments. Regarding the new trend as an answer to the problem he characterized as the overly decorative degenerate mannerism, the “turgidities,” of second-generation abstract expressionism, Greenberg and his followers positioned the flatness, clarity, and “opticality” (as opposed to tactility) of post-painterly abstraction as the leading edge in modern painting. Greenberg’s disciple Michael Fried, while a Harvard graduate student in 1965, famously organized the exhibition Three American Painters: Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Frank Stella at the Fogg. In the accompanying catalogue, he sought to define the self-referential condition of post- painterly abstraction, arguing that such works should be judged on their visual qualities rather than on their historical or social context.\r\nThough Greenberg’s and Fried’s ideas circulated broadly, other lines of abstraction thrived during this period on both sides of the Atlantic. Josef Albers mediated the geographic and temporal divide between the pre- and postwar avant-gardes. A former Bauhaus professor, he continued to be an influential teacher in the United States after immigrating in the 1930s. His mesmerizing, reductive, and repetitive Homage to the Square paintings assumed special relevance for a younger generation of artists exploring anew the frontiers of opticality and seriality. Using found objects and industrial materials, sculptors such as Max Bill, Ellsworth Kelly, Louise Nevelson, and David Smith evoked urban and manufactured forms in works that achieved dynamic effects through light interacting with their surfaces. Photographers, especially those with ties to Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind at the Institute of Design in Chicago and Otto Steinert at the Folkwang School in Essen, Germany, also pushed the boundaries of abstraction in studies of flatness, geometries, and patterns.",

          "labeltext": "The escalation of the Cold War, accompanied by the specter of nuclear annihilation and the rise of totalitarianism, led many artists in the West to invest increasing significance in inward-directed experiences. Struggling with the apparent futility of human progress and the inability of nations to establish just societies, they withdrew from producing art in the service of social causes. For many, the retreat led to pictorial investigations based in abstraction; but for others, the body became a site onto which the psychological anxiety wrought by the political and technological vicissitudes of the mid-century world could be mapped. The often anguished but inscrutable approach to figurative art about the human condition, pursued by a loose confederation of artists active during the 1940s and ’50s, would come to be characterized by critics of the day as “New Images.”\r\nFor this generation, Picasso’s searing mural Guernica (1937), painted in response to the first fascist air raid on a civilian target during the Spanish Civil War, and Max Beckmann’s dystopian compositions became immediate icons of the era and critical models for an artistic path forward. Guernica was on perpetual tour in the United States from 1939 to 1958. When it was installed at the Fogg in the fall of 1941, a Harvard Crimson reviewer noted the effectiveness of the “horrible, almost indecent distortions” of its figures in conveying the artist’s moral outrage. Beckmann’s large-scale triptych Actors (1941–42), on view here, was included in important exhibitions of the artist’s work in America throughout the 1940s and ’50s, and entered the Fogg’s collection in 1955. \r\nWorks by Georg Baselitz and Philip Guston in this gallery point to the broader significance of New Images for the development of diverse approaches to using the body as a discursive subject among a number of key contemporary artists beginning as early as the 1960s and extending to contemporary practice.",

In each, one side of the canvas features a portrait in the manner of late nineteenth-century French artists. The other side, however, shows a different figure, executed in Picasso’s emergent distinctive style. This composition mimics paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec in its palette and short, energetic brushstrokes, while the frontal pose and confrontational gaze of the sitter recall his portraits of the 1890s. This side of the double-sided canvas was traditionally considered the lesser of the two paintings, and it was hung against the wall, hidden from view, in Wertheim’s home.",

By 1908, she had been employed in Renoir’s household for fourteen years, as a nanny, housekeeper, model, and companion to the aging artist.\r\nThis painting’s gold and brownish-red palette, loose brushwork, and stylized, heavy forms typify Renoir’s late work; he adopted the style in response to the ancient murals of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which he had seen in Naples. His direct engagement with the classical past was greatly admired, and was seen as a modern project by many young avant-garde artists, including Picasso and Matisse. The latter visited Renoir frequently in his final years, and praised him in the highest terms: “I have always felt that recorded time holds no nobler story, no more heroic, no more magnificent achievement than that of Renoir.”",

By the 1920s, however, his art had become increasingly abstract, focusing on plays of color and texture, rather than on the realistic depiction of objects. Here, the vibrant reds, greens, and yellows of the fruits contrast with the dominant purple and turquoise jewel tones of the indistinct interior space. Although the cropping of the image may seem random or spontaneous, Bonnard tightly controlled such decisions through his working method. He would tack long rolls of canvas to his studio wall and map out several compositions at once, working on all of them and adjusting their dimensions as he painted. Wertheim acquired this work in 1950; it was the last piece he added to his collection before his death.",

Believing that painting could be reinvented through the genre of portraiture, he encouraged his fellow artists to paint themselves, and then to exchange the canvases. After receiving self-portraits from Emile Bernard and Gauguin, who were working together in Brittany at the time, Van Gogh inscribed this painting “To my friend Paul Gauguin,” and sent it to him. He described the process of creating his arresting likeness in several letters to his brother Theo, an art dealer in Paris, explaining how he manipulated his features in response to Japanese prints, changed the contours of his jacket for coloristic effect, and painted the background “pale veronese green” without any shadows. Shortly after he sent the work to Gauguin, however, their friendship deteriorated, and Gauguin sold it for three hundred francs.",

The muted palette, blocks of interrupted color, and abstracted forms with strong outlines typify the artist’s approach at this stage, one of the most celebrated of his career. The discordant styles and confrontational poses in the portraits on both sides of this canvas represent a bold and humorous assertion of his developing style. While it stands in stark contrast to Toulouse-Lautrec’s technique, which Picasso imitates on the other side of the canvas, his depiction of a dour, solitary figure in a café interior reinterprets a subject long favored by the impressionists. Picasso’s paintings from 1901 include numerous depictions of a dark-haired woman with this “chignon” hairstyle, a tight bun on the crown of the head.",

While completing the series, Monet relocated from the town of Argenteuil to an apartment near the station in Paris. He worked on all the paintings at the same time, and sometimes he leaned the stretched canvases against each other while the paint was still wet. This caused the cork spacers on the backs of the stretchers to be pressed into the adjacent paintings, creating circular indentations in the surface that are visible along the top edge of this work. Monet’s thick build-up of pigments here is a virtuosic example of his approach to painting during this period, when he juxtaposed multitudinous hues in mounds of impasto that would blend into a coherent whole only when viewed from a distance. This technique reportedly led Cézanne to declare, “Monet is only an eye, but my God what an eye!”",

This plaster typifies Maillol’s approach to neoclassicism, in which he simplified forms and emphasized the geometry of his subject. As he declared: “I don’t make portraits, I make heads in which I try to give an impression of the whole. A head interests me when I can bring the architecture out in it.” This sitter’s frozen, placid expression, her frontal orientation toward the viewer, and her idealized features speak to the ancient sources that inspired her form. The plaster is covered in painted washes to imitate a bronze patina.",

It captures a sequence of movement, revealing, as his equestrian bronzes also do, Degas’s fascination with the stop-action photography of Eadweard Muybridge. Unlike the photographs, however, Degas’s three-dimensional figures explore the full spatial and physical complexity of motion.",

This is the largest of this group of works dating from the artist’s “Blue Period” (1901–4); they unite contemporary social concerns with an iconic Christian theme. The mother’s attenuated limbs speak to Picasso’s close study of the work of earlier artists, particularly El Greco.\r\nLike many paintings in this gallery, this one was executed on a reused canvas, and another composition lies beneath this scene. That painting is a portrait of Picasso’s friend, the poet Max Jacob, who sits in his study surrounded by books. Some evidence of the image is still visible, particularly the contours of the face, which is roughly the same size as the mother’s head and is located above her knees.",

He shared their commitment to depicting modern pastimes, as in this scene of a popular roller skating rink. The sport had exploded as a fashionable French pursuit in the 1870s, with five lavish rinks opening in Paris over a two-year period. The main figure here wears a chic outfit, which is displayed at its most alluring angle, accentuating its wearer’s curves. The dress contrasts starkly with the more typical all-black day dresses of the women in the middle ground. As he worked on this composition, Manet made the young child in the foreground increasingly indistinct, focusing the viewer’s attention almost exclusively on her stylish and attractive mother. The model for this figure, Henriette Hauser, was the mistress of the Prince of Orange and an aspiring actress. Manet painted her several times.",
